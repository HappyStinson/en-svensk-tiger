ESTS is a multiplayer game that takes place in a Swedish city during World War II.
Three players take control of a Swedish spy, a German and a Russian soldier.
The task of the spy is to stay hidden in the crowds while he has to
collect secret documents.
The mission of the soldiers is to find the spy among the civilians before the second soldier does
as well as preventing the spy from collecting the secret documents.

This 2D game was made by [Rasmus Nordling](https://github.com/happystinson) and [Michael Cassel](https://github.com/mcassel) during the [BOSS Jam 2015](https://boss.bthstudent.se/bossjam/boss-jam-2015/).

## Interpretation of the theme

**Theme**: En svensk tiger (a Swedish tiger)

We chose to focus on the use of "a Swedish tiger" as propaganda during World War II
to prevent secret information from ending in foreign spies' hands.
The game includes a blue and yellow tiger who gives feedback to the players.
